When she finds that host, she allows her target to consume her by drinking water or wine. She then infects her host's mind and slowly turns them toward madness.

					"With the Blood War between devils and demons raging for eons and no end in sight, opportunities abound for ambitious archdevils to win fame, glory, and power in the ongoing struggle. Duke Bael, one of Mammon's most important vassals, has won fame and acclaim for his victories. Charged with leading sixty-six companies of {@creature barbed devil||barbed devils}, Bael has proven to be a tactical genius, earning esteem for himself and his master as a result of victory after victory over the abyssal host. Mammon relies on Bael to safeguard his holdings because of Bael's battle acumen. During a time when so many other archdevils have lost their positions, Mammon has never been ousted, which is a testament to Bael's skill on the battlefield.",
					"For his accomplishments, Bael has been granted the title of Bronze General. His accolades notwithstanding, he has had a difficult time navigating the quagmire of infernal politics. His critics call him naive, though never to his face. His primary interest has always been leading soldiers in battle, so he finds it frustrating to have his ambitions of ascending to a higher rank constantly stymied by politically shrewd rivals.",
					"Bael prefers to make servants out of his adversaries, and mortals bound to his service earn their wretched place by falling victim to his superior stratagems. Bael gladly spares the lives of those he defeatsâ€”if they pledge their souls and service to him. Demons are an exception; although he is willing to corrupt almost any other foes, he always destroys demons he defeats.",
					"Bael also welcomes mortals into his service if they can provide him with an advantage in his politicking. He recruits savvy individuals and relies on them to represent his interests at Mammon's court, which leaves him free to pursue his battle lust.",
					"Despite his lack of interest in affairs outside battle, or perhaps because of it, Bael has gained a small following of cultists. Those who worship at his altar call him the King of Hell, and the most deluded believe that he is the lord of all devils. In arcane circles, certain writings, such as the dreaded Book of Fire, say that Bael revealed the invisibility spell to the world, though some scholars of magic hotly refute such claims. Bael is sometimes depicted as a toad, a cat, a human, or some combination of these forms."

Knowing he has enemies on all sides and fearing he'll be displaced like Moloch, Geryon, and so many others, he almost never travels farther than the sprawling city that lies outside his palace.",
					"Dispater is correct to fear, but the true threat comes not from without. The lord's great error was allowing himself to be seduced by Titivilus, who beguiled his way into being the primary advisor in Dispater's household.",
					"Although Titivilus is inferior in physical strength and power when compared to other archdevils, he compensates with cunning. A shrewd politician, he has clawed his way up through the ranks to become the second-most powerful devil in Dis, entirely by saying the right thing at the right time to get what he wanted. Charming and pleasant, he is a master at negotiation, able to twist words so as to leave his victims confused and believing he's on their side. Through these skills, Titivilus has manipulated everyone along his path to power, either to win them over to his cause or to remove them as a threat.",
					"Since gaining his position, Titivilus has convinced Dispater that countless plots are being hatched against him and that Asmodeus himself seeks to remove Dispater from power. In response, Dispater has withdrawn to his palace and left day-to-day decisions to Titivilus, even authorizing him to answer and negotiate bargains with mortals who attempt to summon Dispater. Titivilus now represents his master and speaks with his voice, a turn of events that leads some to whisper that either Titivilus is Dispater in disguise or Titivilus has removed the archduke and replaced him altogether.",
					"Titivilus recognizes the precariousness of his position. After all, Dispater's acceptance of his plans and his advice can last only so long before some other plotter steps in and reveals the truth. For insurance, Titivilus has begun recruiting outsiders to deal with problem devils, to insulate him against criticism, and, above all, to create complications that he can solve so as to reinforce his value in the eyes of his master. Titivilus finds adventurers well suited to the tasks he needs performed and recruits them directly or through intermediaries, expending them later as his plans require."

Her innate magical prowess brought her to the attention of the fledgling order of the Knights of Bahamut. The Knights of Bahamut were an order of dragon riders that worshipped Bahamut and bonded to young metallic dragons.",
					"The rise of the Knights of Bahamut was meteoric in its speed, but so was their fall. They vanished from the history books in 250 DR, victims of their own success. Fearful of the rising power of the Knights of Bahamut, their enemies formed an alliance that struck quickly and brutally. When the final days came, Suldil was a veteran dragon rider bonded to a beautiful bronze dragon. She was happily married and the proud mother to a son. In a single night Suldil lost everything. She survived only through the intervention of a nymph of the Feywild. The nymph took Suldil into her sylvan realm at night when the enemies of the Knights of Bahamut were killing the other riders, dragons and their families.",
					"Suldil would stay in the Feywild for a decade. Not out of her own choice, but because of the obsession of the nymph. The fey creature was enamored with Suldil and had no desire to let her go. It was only through years of Suldil's pleas that the nymph finally allowed the former knight to return to her world. When Suldil was finally released from the Feywild, a decade had passed for her, but a millennium had passed in the mortal world. It was the harshest way to learn that time flows differently in the Feywild.",
					"Suldil is disheartened that the Knights of Bahamut have vanished from history. She prayed to Bahamut and was surprised when she was given a vision. The vision led her to the lair of a bronze dragon killed by fortune hunters. One of the dragon's eggs was hidden beneath a pile of copper that the hunters had left behind. Suldil bonded with the bronze wyrmling that hatched from the egg a few months later.",

					"Zythan, like many other Halruaans, spent his early years studying the arcane arts. His talent in Divination magic made him particularly useful to the Conclave, and they quickly sought him out. Under their tutelage, his skill flourished, and he became a powerful mage. Those that know him personally recount his matter-of-fact personality, his green hair, and his third eye that seems to open when he performs magic. He rarely speaks of himself, however, choosing instead to focus his attention on the future.",
					"When he first received an official position within the Conclave, Zythan wanted to prove himself. He spent countless hours peering into the future and examining potential outcomes. One fateful night, he just barely caught sight of a forbidden ritual being preparedâ€”a ritual that could cost the lives of many Halruaans. Because of his sight, the Conclave was able to intervene in time, and he was quickly promoted and showered with praise.",
					"For the past few months, Zythan has felt like something was off: at first, he suspected another ritual within Halruaa. He requisitioned the help of the other diviners, as well as a powerful Crystal Ball, and together they were able to piece together a vision. The dark lord of the Nine Hells, Asmodeus, will unleash a great evil very soon. Though the Conclave often stays out of non-Halruaan affairs, they had no choice but to act. It is for this reason that the adventurers were called to Halruaa.",
					"Zythan's skill in arcane magic, while particularly focused on Divination, extends to every school. While he lacks proficiency in martial combat, he can wield both offensive and defensive magic effectively. Outside of his magical talent, he is also known to be highly intelligent, though his social skills could use work. Much of his time is spent viewing alternate futures and preparing for potential dangers, leaving little for himself. He often goes without meals until he starts to feel weak, and if he had friends, they might be concerned about how much time he spends working."
